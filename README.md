# Campvue Chatbot POC

Work-in-progress proof of concept exploring how to integrate **LLM-powered natural-language search** into Campvue’s campground database.  

**Goals**
- Demonstrate integration of OpenAI / Anthropic APIs with Supabase (pgvector).  
- Enable natural-language queries such as  
  *“show me campgrounds in Utah that are state or national parks with tent pads and accessible sites.”*  
- Optimize for cost, latency, and truthful, data-grounded responses.  

This project supports my application for AI-focused engineering roles (e.g., Zapier AI Engineer) and will evolve into a production feature for Campvue.
